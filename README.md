This app is a basic sanbox app that queries the google books API

and displays the results in a react application.

I have opted to showcase the basic search by query string and the ability to orderBy and filterBy

Note:
Basic pagination was also implemented, however the ability to skip to the last page was commented out as it cause a back end error.

Required:

- git
- Nodejs

Steps:

- clone project: git clone https://github.com/jasonsrogers/google-books-api-react-jest.git
- open directory: cd google-books-api-react-jest
- initialise project : `npm install`
- run project : `npm start`
  (should open browser to http://localhost:3000)
- run jest tests: `npm test`
